  SNCO - Stalking No Contact Order Request
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **SNCO - Stalking No Contact Order Request** Easy Form.

  This program will help you make forms to get a Stalking No Contact Order against someone who has done things that made you fearful for your safety or caused you emotional distress. The forms you make with this program can only be used in Illinois.

  If the victim of stalking is not you, but a child or an adult who is not capable of filing a petition, you may file a petition on behalf of the victim.

  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**Getting a no contact order for stalking**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/getting-no-contact-order-stalking).

template: distress_explainer
subject: |
  **What counts as emotional distress or stalking?**
content: |  
  **Emotional distress** means feeling a lot of mental pain, worry, or fear.

  **Stalking** is when someone acts in a way they know, or should know, would make a normal person scared for their safety or feel very upset. Stalking does not include an exercise of the right to free speech or assembly. It does not include lawful picketing at the workplace.

#Is it a concern that the ILAO article talks about 3 types of protective order when only 2 are available here?
id: order type
question: |
  What kind of Stalking No Contact Order do you want?
subquestion: |
  There are two kinds of SNCO: a Plenary Order and an Emergency Order. You can ask the court for both if you want.
  
  For a Plenary Order, the court will issue an order after a hearing at which the abuser can also present a case. This order can last a long time, usually two years. It can even be made permanent in some cases.

  For an Emergency Order, the court will issue an order which takes effect immediately. The order can be issued even before your abuser knows that you have filed a petition. However, the order only lasts 21 days, or until a formal court hearing where the abuser can present a case to the court also. 
  
  To learn more, read ILAO's article about the [**3 types of Orders of Protection**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/3-types-orders-protection).
